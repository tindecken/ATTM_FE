  ☐ detail view --> testAUT should be a selection instead of input string
  ✔ detail view - configure autocomplete for keyword column (able to search) @done(21-02-02 22:49)
  ☐ add mockdata for multiple category, multiple t-est suite, multiple test groups, allow generate code from multiple categories
  ☐ generate code for multiple category
  ☐ treeview - paint the category --> testsuite --> testgroup
  ☐ treewiew - paint the category --> testsuite --> testgroup --> testcase
  ☐ treeview - reformat, using slot for it
  ☐ treeview - testcase without step should highlight to know it.
API:
  ✔ api for saving testcase @done(21-01-23 22:28)
  ☐ api for generate code from testcases
  ✔ api for list all testAUT @done(21-02-02 18:47)
  ✔ .net 5.0 support openAPI by default (swagger) ==> implement it. @done(20-12-19 17:17)
